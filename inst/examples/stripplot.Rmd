This package provides a interactive rug plot: it plots the values of a labelled numeric vector.
`d3rug` is inspired by the [strip plot of Maarten Lambrechts]()

```{r}
library(d3rug)
income <- state.x77[,2]
d3rug(income, height="100px")
```

The user can see the labels of the values by moving the mouse to the value.

The `d3rug` function can be tuned and adapted in the following ways:

- with argument `col` different colors can be set: if `col` is of length 1, all stripes will have the same s=cor

```{r}
illiteracy_levels <- cut(state.x77[,3], 5)
pal <- colorRampPalette(c("green","gray", "orange"))(nlevels(illiteracy_levels))
col = pal[illiteracy_levels]
d3rug(income, color=col)
```

You can supply your own labels:
```{r}
d3rug(income, labels=state.abb)
```

- with argument `col_hover` the color for hovering a value can be set.

```{r}
d3rug(income, color_hover = "red")
```
